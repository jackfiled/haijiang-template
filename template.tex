These are instructions for authors typesetting for paper reviews. This template has been prepared using the required format (Microsoft Word version 6.0 or later). 

\subsection{Instructions for authors}

An electronic copy of your report must be uploaded to ucloud.

\section{Formatting instructions}

Please use the styles contained in this document for: Title, Abstract, Keywords, Heading 1, Heading 2, Body Text, Equations, References, Figures, and Captions. 
\textit{Do not add any page numbers and do not use footers and headers (it is ok to have footnotes).}

\subsection{Length}

Check homework assignment for details.

\subsection{Title}

Type the title approximately 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) from the top of the first page and use 20 points type-font size in bold. Center the title (horizontally) on the page. Leave approximately 1 centimeter (0.4- inches) between the title and the name and address of yourself (and of your co-authors, if any.) Type name(s) and address(s) in 11 points and center them (horizontally) on the page. Note that authors are advised not to include their email addresses.

\subsection{Section and subsection headings}

\subsubsection{Subsection within another subsection}

Number section and subsection headings consecutively in numbers and type them in bold. Use point size 14 for section headings and 12 for subsection headings and 10 for subsection within a subsection.

\subsubsection{Additional instructions on sections and subsections}

Avoid using too many capital letters. All section headings including the subsection headings should be flushed left.

\subsection{Main text}

Use at least 2 centimeters (0.75 inch) for the left and right margins. Leave a 0.6 centimeters (0.25 inch) space between the two columns in the center of the page. Use font size (character size) 10 for text. The text should be prepared with single line spacing. Do not use bold in the main text. If you want to emphasize specific parts of the main text, use italics. Leave at least 2.0-2.5 centimeters   margin at the page head (top of each page) for placing final page numbers and headers (final page numbers and running heads will be inserted by the publisher). Select a standard size paper such as A4 (210 X 297 mm) or letter (8.5 X 11 in) when preparing your manuscript.	

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be numbered consecutively. Table headings should be placed above the table. Tables should be as close as possible to where they are mentioned in the main text. Tables can span the two columns if need be within the page margins.

\subsection{Figures}

All illustrations, drawings, and photographic images will be printed in black and white. We recommend that you examine a printed copy of your paper (in black and white) and make the final adjustments before submission. All illustrations must be numbered consecutively (i.e., not section-wise). Center the figure captions beneath the figure. Do not assemble figures at the back of your article, but place them as close as possible to where they are mentioned in the main text. Figures can span the two columns if need be within the page margins.

\subsection{Mathematical formulas}

Mathematical formulas should be roughly centered and numbered, as in: 

\begin{equation}
y = f(x)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Page numbering}

\textit{Do not number any pages in your reports and do not reference page numbers in the text.}

\subsection{Fine tuning}

Do not end a page with a section or subsection heading. Keep footnotes to a minimum. 

\subsection{Finalization}

Proofread your reports. Otherwise, you'll lose points for your careless mistakes.

\section{Conclusion}

This template presents the formatting instructions for the reports.  Please address any problems related to use of this template to Dr. Hai Jiang by Email (\href{hai.jiang@bupt.edu.cn}{hai.jiang@bupt.edu.cn}).

\section{References}

Number in square brackets (“[ ]”) should cite references to the literature in the main text\cite{lamport1994document}\cite{waldrop2016more}. List the cited references in numerical order at the very end of your paper (under the heading `References'). Start each referenced paper on a new line (by its number in square brackets).
